# The Plan Until Mod 1 #
 - There are three main categories for me to focus within as Nov 28th approaches:
 1. What to Maintain 
 2. What to Begin
 3. What to Avoid / Stop

 ## What to Maintain ##
 - Allocate a portion of each week to individual / self care time. (5 hrs / week)
 - Allocate a portion of each week to time with Elisa / getting out of the apartment. (3-5 hrs / week)
 - Allocate an opportunity between each *module* to time having friends over for a DnD session. Keep DnD friends aware of when Turing will not allow for such a session well in advance of cancelling.
 - Continue eating properly, look into Factor meal kits or similar for convenience.
 - Keep taking prescribed medicines, make sure that I have current health insurance and verify that I can / cannot get it discounted based off of last years income.
 - Exercise daily: predominantly stretches, short walks, body weight exercise, etc.
 - Call family at least once a week: Keep similar schedule for calling loved ones throughout Turing, make sure to spend time within each call not talking about Turing itself or my position within it! Give self at least 2 hours per week of reaching out to family. 
 - Allow self moments of creative expression as long as the gesture is small in scope and time demand. Notes, small crafts, etc will go a long way towards maintaining mood and emotional balance with Elisa. 

## What to Begin ##
 ### Solidify sleep schedule:
- establish with Elisa and begin living that schedule today, both of us benefit.
- If live sessions are at 9 AM each day, how many hours do I want between the start of my day and waking up? (2.5 ideally), wake up @ 6:30 AM. Bedtime then should be 10:30 at latest.
### Keep Practicing / Dive Back into JS: 
- Dive headfirst into Jonas Schmetdmann's Udemy javascript course to practice syntax and basics, now that I have Mod 0 background context in mind. GET AT LEAST HALFWAY THROUGH before Mod 1: This will require daily practice of at least 1.5 hours.
### Begin using Apartment Complex exercise room!
- This is a simple one - use the resource I have available to allow myself options for exercise even throughout the winter. Use the treadmills while reviewing hand written notes or listening to podcasts, or even while listening to the next lesson / section on the Udemy course for JS.
- When feeling frustrated in general, use exercise to break the cycle and use the energy for positive growth or stress relief. 
### Decorate for the Holidays
- Work on whatever decoration Elisa and I want up in time for Christmas before Mod 1 starts: This will be a morale boost and it will also take a time-expensive activity off of the incoming hectic schedule.
### Delegate Apartment Chores / Establish Chore role cycling
- Have a short conversation with Elisa establishing expectations for Turing, my role as a caretaker of our shared space, and what my priorities should be when I can only do one or two things to help.
