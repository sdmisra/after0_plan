# The Plan Until Mod 1 #
 - There are three main categories for me to focus within as Nov 28th approaches:
 1. What to Maintain 
 2. What to Begin
 3. What to Avoid / Stop

 ## What to Maintain ##
 - # Allocate a portion of each week to individual / self care time. (5 hrs / week)
 - Allocate a portion of each week to time with Elisa / getting out of the apartment. (3-5 hrs / week)
 - Allocate an opportunity between each *module* to time having friends over for a DnD session.
 - Continue eating properly, look into Factor meal kits or similar for convenience.
 - Keep taking prescribed medicines, make sure that I have current health insurance and verify that I can / cannot get it discounted based off of last years income.
 - Exercise daily: predominantly stretches, short walks, body weight exercise, etc. 

## What to Begin ##
 ### Solidify sleep schedule:
- establish with Elisa and begin living that schedule today, both of us benefit.
- If live sessions are at 9 AM each day, how many hours do I want between the start of my day and waking up? (2.5 ideally), wake up @ 6:30 AM. Bedtime then should be 10:30 at latest.
### Keep Practicing / Dive Back into JS: 
- Dive headfirst into Jonas Schmetdmann's Udemy javascript course to practice syntax and basics, now that I have Mod 0 background context in mind. GET AT LEAST HALFWAY THROUGH before Mod 1: This will require daily practice of at least 1.5 hours.
